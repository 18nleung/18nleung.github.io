An app which would show users who was in their classes.  Written using a <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com" target="_blank">ExpressJS</a>, and <a href="http://mongodb.org" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> backend with <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://jade-lang.com" target="_blank">Jade</a> on the front-end.  Users would log in on the site and their classes would be scraped from the school's class-management system.  Their data would be cross-referenced with that submitted by other students to see if that student was in a certain class.
