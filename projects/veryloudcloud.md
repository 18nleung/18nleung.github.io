I've been interested in programming for a long time, and after starting to learn Javascript in January 2014 I made my first app, 
VeryLoudCloud, as part of a school project. Our school had purchased a course-management system that the faculty found very frustrating
and unintuitive, so I designed this alternative system (VeryLoudCloud) that I attempted to make more intuitive and easy-to-use. While 
I didn't exactly succeed in creating a viable competitor to LoudCloud, my passion for creating things that make the life easier and
better still remains.
