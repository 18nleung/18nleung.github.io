I'm Nathan, lead web designer and developer at [Leung Enterprises](https://www.leungenterprises.com/).

I enjoy making cool stuff, primary with Javascript.  Visit my [GitHub profile](http://github.com/nathanhleung) to see a few things that I've made.

My webapp stack usually consists of [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org), [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com), and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). I use [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) when I want to make something quick.

My frontend dev toolkit consists of [Harp](http://harpjs.com), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com), [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), and quite a few [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) plugins.

I'm learning [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and after that I'd like to learn [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) or mobile app development with [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/).

For a full list of my skills, experience, and education, feel to download my [résumé](/public/uploads/Resume%20of%20Nathan%20Leung.pdf).
