DJ Khaled: world-renowned producer and artist, or enlightened zen master? With his insightful witticisms taking Snapchat by storm, it can be hard to tell.

First, a quick biography. Khaled was born on November 26, 1975 in New Orleans to Palestinian parents. From humble roots as an employee at a local record store, he has risen through the entertainment industry to become a household name with his own label, We the Best Music. His albums have consistently reached the top of the Billboard 200, and he often collaborates with other wildly popular artists, such as Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Drake.

Recently, Khaled has been gaining even more fame for being one of the first celebrities to gain mainstream media attention through Snapchat. The extremely quotable phrases he sprinkles throughout his Stories have spread uncontrollably through the internet, and this newfound “fan luv” has risen to such heights that Khaled has even started an online store with his quotes printed on them—business is booming, by the way.

Despite being seemingly facetious, his witticisms strike a chord with the large and growing millennial population that has been disillusioned by financial crisis and crippling student debt, revealing deeper, hidden aspects of the millennial persona.  Starting from his most famous quote, “bless up,” it becomes clear why Khaled is seen as the messiah that millennials have been searching for.

* “Bless up”: With a mountain of student debt and losses from the financial crisis still cutting deep, millennials feel trapped and unhappy, and for us, with high-stakes standardized tests, extracurriculars, and athletics, we too are subjected to an unprecedented amount of pressure and stress. Khaled helps relieve this stress, reminding us that in spite of our busy, fractured, and sometimes overwhelming lives, we must find time to count our blessings and remember what we’re lucky enough to have.
* “Lost at sea”: One of Khaled’s most famous Story sequences was when he got lost at sea on his jetski. His followers were glued to the story, eagerly consuming every update. After hours of wandering the Miami coastline, Khaled eventually got back home, and issued a warning to his fans to not ride their jet skis after dark. While it may seem trivial, this sequence exposed Khaled’s humanity, showed that he can make mistakes too, and increased his credibility and thus the credibility of his Stories.
* “Major key”: Khaled’s Stories always show him having fun, whether he’s working or just hanging out.  In fact, he is the epitome of the millennial ideal: to love what one does and to achieve a healthy work-life balance. Khaled’s “major keys” to success resonate with millennials who want to achieve the same kind of success and happiness that he does.
* “Fan luv”: When Khaled goes out into the city, he’s always mobbed by fans, and it’s obvious that his message resonates deeply with them—you can hear “bless up” and “major key” often in the background. His fans’ deep knowledge of his words and routines show that he has impacted millions people positively around the globe. Likewise, millennials also share a common goal to make a meaningful impact of the world. Khaled’s continued positive impacts appeal to millennials and inspire them to do the same.
* “They don’t want you to”: Khaled is always doing stuff that “they don’t want you to,” and he’s achieved success in spite of that. Millennials are out to change the world, and Khaled’s reminders that “[the establishment] don’t want you to” appeal to this attitude.  Like his “major keys,” Khaled’s stories of doing what “they (didn’t) want you to” appeal to millennials’ desire to shake up the system.
* “Chef Dee, what’s good?”: Each day, Khaled wakes up and has a breakfast of egg whites, turkey sausage, and water, specially prepared by his chef, Chef Dee. This healthy breakfast routine is analogous to many millennials’ fascination with fast-casual places like Chipotle, Panera, and Bryn and Dane’s (“healthy fast food”). Starting the day with a healthy, homemade meal like Khaled does every day is a dream shared by many busy millennials.
* “How’s business?”: Khaled often meets up with a sixteen-year-old entrepreneur known as the “Sneaker Don” and asks him how business is doing. Starting from a single pair of sneakers, the Don built up sizeable capital resources and acquired even more shoes—currently, he moves over  $1 million of kicks a year. As his business boomed, his extensive collection of limited-release sneakers got the attention of artists and producers such as DJ Khaled. The Don’s success story is a realization of the millennial dream of working for oneself and his success appeals to the entrepreneurial aspirations of millennials.  Khaled’s interactions with the Don show millennials an inside look at what entrepreneurial success is like (albeit idealized), and what their life could be like if they just followed their heart.

With a little bit of investigation, it becomes clear that Khaled’s offbeat Stories are more than they seem to be. They  reveal hidden facets of a large and growing subset of the population, millennials, and Khaled’s antics are an idealized realization of that population’s tendencies and aspirations. Most importantly, though, is that he tells viewers of his Stories how they can realize that same dream, through his useful and insightful keys to success. Here’s another one: add him @djkhaled305!
